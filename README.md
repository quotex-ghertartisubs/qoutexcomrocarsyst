## What is Fixed Time Trades (FTD)?

Fixed Time Trades (FTD) are a type of financial derivative that allows
traders to speculate on the future price of an asset. FTDs are
short-term contracts that expire at a predetermined time. The trader\'s
goal is to correctly predict whether the price of the asset will be
higher or lower than the strike price at the expiration time.

## How do FTDs work?

FTDs are traded on the Quotex platform in the following way:

1.  The trader selects the asset they want to trade.
2.  The trader chooses the expiration time for the trade.
3.  The trader predicts whether the price of the asset will be higher or
    lower than the strike price at the expiration time.
4.  The trader places the trade.
5.  If the trader\'s prediction is correct, they will profit from the
    trade. If the trader\'s prediction is incorrect, they will lose
    their investment.

## What are the benefits of trading FTDs?

There are several benefits to trading FTDs, including:

-   FTDs are a short-term trading instrument, which means that traders
    can profit from small price movements.
-   FTDs are easy to understand and trade, making them suitable for both
    beginners and experienced traders.
-   FTDs offer the potential for high returns.

## What are the risks of trading FTDs?

As with any type of trading, there are also risks associated with
trading FTDs. These risks include:

-   The potential for losses. If the trader\'s prediction is incorrect,
    they will lose their investment.
-   The volatility of the underlying asset. The price of the underlying
    asset can fluctuate significantly, which can lead to losses.

## Is FTD trading right for me?

FTD trading can be a profitable way to trade, but it is not suitable for
everyone. Traders who are considering trading FTDs should carefully
consider the risks involved and their own financial situation before
making any decisions.
